## üåü Task 1 - Bitcoin Data Analysis (Excel)


#### Bitcoin Prices in Excel:<br>
> This project will guide you through an analysis of Bitcoin price data using all the Excel. You‚Äôll import and clean the dataset, explore the numeric data with pivot tables and
formulas, and communicate your findings using visualizations.

#### The Scenario:<br>
> Manuela, the Head of Finance at your company, has requested an analysis of the performance of Bitcoin.
She‚Äôs intrigued by the potential upsides but worried about volatility. She‚Äôs asked for a report comparing
the behavior of Bitcoin in the last year (2021) to the behavior of the S&P500, an index often used as the
standard for stability. In her email, she attached a dataset with data on both Bitcoin and the S&P500 for
you to analyze.
